//Input: int 
//Output: int - money
//Logic: 
//1. Calculate full week, completeWeek=n/7
//2. Calculate leftDays =n%7
//3. Calculate runCountForLastwWeek using 1+n/7
//4. Full week follows an AP of 28, 35 with d 5.So, calculate sum of AP using (n * [2 * a + (n - 1) * d]) / 2
//5. Caluclate the leftDays' money using (leftDays * (2 * runCountForLastwWeek + (leftDays - 1) * 1)) / 2
//6. return sum  of full week and leftovrs
