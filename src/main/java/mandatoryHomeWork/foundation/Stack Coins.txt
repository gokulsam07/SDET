//Input: int 
//Outupt: int - count of complete staircase
//Logic:
//Initialize i=1,count =0;
// Run a while loop till n>=i (if it is less, it means we are in last row which is incomplete or completed last row with  zero)
// Subtract i from n and store in n
// Increment i and count by 1 
//return count
